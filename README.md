# city_park_app
A generic city park app

## The idea
A white-labeling app for city parks.

Planned range of functions:
- You can add your annual ticket (barcode or QR code)
- You can buy a day ticket (or similar)
- You can view the park's opening hours
- You can view the opening hours for individual park attractions
- You can view the events calendar
- You can view the park map
- The app should support more than one park, whereby you as the user select which parks should be visible. Not all features must be available for every supported park.

## The concept
The source code is and remains public. This project thrives on developers making public contributions to the project.
