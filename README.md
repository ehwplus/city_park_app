# city_park_app
A generic city park app

## The idea
A white-labeling app for city parks.

Planned range of functions:
- You can add your annual ticket (barcode or QR code)
- You can buy a day ticket (or similar)
- You can view the park's opening hours
- You can view the opening hours for individual park attractions
- You can view the events calendar
- You can view the park map
- The app should support more than one park, whereby you as the user select which parks should be visible. Not all features must be available for every supported park.

## The concept
The source code is and remains public. This project thrives on developers making public contributions to the project. The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 ensures that the code of forks must also be published again.
